# LambdaScript 2 - a Declarative Programming Language inspired by Scala and Haskell

## Foreword

Hello, a thank you for taking the time to look at LambdaScript 2.

In May 2023, I began working on LambdaScript, an interpreter for a functional programming language. I worked on the project for about a year, and I had a lot of fun working on it. However, I eventually realized that there were some fundamental issues with the project's architecture, and decided to start over from scratch.

LambdaScript 2 is the result of that decision. Currently, LambdaScript 2 has a lexer, parser, and type checker for some of the fundamental language features. I plan to add many more language features, implement a compiler to JavaScript, write a VSCode extension, and make a website for it.
